# Introduction
This repository contains my code for practical sessions of the ECE253 Digital and Computer Systems course. The course covers concepts such as digital logic, optimisation (Karnaugh maps), sequential circuits, storage elements, Verilog FPGA development, CPU architecture, and ARM assembly coding. 

The code was developed and tested based on Altera Quartus Prime and Altera Monitor Program, on a De1-SoC board.
